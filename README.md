## üõ§Ô∏è Architecture

- **Frontend (Streamlit):**  
  `frontend.py` provides the user interface for inputting search parameters, displaying visualizations, and hosting the interactive chat.

- **Backend Processing:**  
  `backend.py` contains core logic for:
  - Web scraping LinkedIn job listings
  - NLP text cleaning using NLTK
  - AI-powered skill extraction via Gemini 2.0 Flash
  - Database operations with SQLite
  - Visualization generation with Plotly

- **API Layer:**  
  `main.py` implements a FastAPI server with endpoints for:
  - `/scrape-jobs`: Job listing extraction
  - `/extract-skills`: Skill identification from descriptions
  - `/pipeline`: Full end-to-end processing

- **App Entry Point:**  
  `app.py` provides a simplified interface to the backend pipeline for direct application usage.
